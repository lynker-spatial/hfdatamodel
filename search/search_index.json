It builds upon and extends the OGC WaterML 2.0 Part 3: Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) standard (OGC 14-111r6), translating conceptual classes into tangible, high-performance data structures ment to meet the needs of multiscale and divergent modeling activities, increasing cloud based access, and provding a backbone for AI/ML modeling in the weather and water space.  This implementation improves upon past efforts by USGS and NOAA to position hydrology for the emerging Data-as-a-Service paradigm \u2014 interoperable, cloud-native, and AI/ML-ready.

Central to this model are catchments, which represent the areas of land draining into hydrologic features; hydro networks, which express the topological connectivity of streams and rivers; and hydrolocations, which anchor the system to specific points of observation or control.  </p> <p>HY_Features provides the critical benefit of semantic consistency across implementations worldwide (or at least with respect to the countries/agencies of the contributing authors). It ensures that catchments, stream networks, and observation points can be referenced and exchanged in a common way, supporting global interoperability in languguage and intent. At the same time, HY_Features is intentionally abstract. It describes a set of what _has__ be represented in the past, but it does not prescribe how those entities should be implemented in practice, or what must be represeneted. This leaves open the need for operational schemas that respect the conceptual model while delivering on performance, scalability, and integration.  </p>"},{"location":"#the-hydrofabric-data-model","title":"The Hydrofabric Data Model","text":"<p>THe Lynker Hydrofabric fills this gap by providing a concrete implementation of HY_Features for U.S. national-scale workflows (which can be extended globally with accompanying <code>lynker-spatial/hf*</code> software suite). Our model defines Flowpaths as the canonical routed stream segments that carry identifiers, downstream references, and deterministic  ordering. Each flowpath is linked to a polygonal Divide that represents its contributing area and associated landscape properties.  </p> <p>For finer-grained, multi-scale, or disjoint hydrologic/hydraulic analysis - our Hydrofabric introduces Incremental Areas, which partition divides into smaller units that can be rolled up or disaggregated as needed for proportional hydrologic accounting. Underlying these incremental areas are Flowlines, which represent the most granular routing primitives, which aggregate into flowpaths but maintain the detail required for high-resolution studies (e.g. street scale flood mapping, high resoltuion routing, and detailed cartography).  </p> <p>Solid hydrologic modeling is as much hydrologic process reprensentation as it is accurate input data whether it be meterlogic forcings, observations data for training/calibration, or even insitu data assimulation. While most hydrographic products \"link\" or \"cross-walk\" data primarilty based on spatial proxiity (a dangerous operation when dealing with loosly accurate location data, and high resolution stream networks). Our hydrofabric is equipt with a set of over a quarter millions cafefully currated Hydrolocations sourced from systems like NWIS, NBI, NWS, HiLARRI, the WBD or other critical sturcutral features of the network that are mapped to the flowline representation of our primary network. Hydrolocations carry both their native identifiers and crosswalk keys as explicit source metadata (<code>hl_type</code>, <code>hl_link</code>), derive persisted unique identifiers (PID) and carry semantic classification (<code>hl_class</code>) enabling them to be seamlessly integrated into the Hydrofabric and used for (1) data manipulation (e.g. ensuring breaks in the network) (2) data assimulation (3) evaluation and (4) other tasks were multiple data streams can be used to enhance a given applications. The sheer number of relevant - but colaocated hydrolocations (e.g. a dam and gage both sitting on the outlet of a waterbody) require entities to be rolled up into critical network locations. Anchoring the hydrofabric network are Points of Interest (POIs), which serve as named aggregation points where 1 or more hydrolocations are embeded in the geofabric.</p> <p>Finally, Hydrofabric offers a Network table, a denormalized, query-ready view that blends flowpaths, divides, POIs, and hydrolocations.
